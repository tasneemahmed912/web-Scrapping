# web-Scrapping
Web Scraping Project on Wuzzuf Website
Overview
This project involves web scraping data on job postings from the Wuzzuf website, which is a popular job search website in Egypt.
The goal of this project is to extract relevant information about job postings such as job title, company name, location, salary range, and job description. 
We then store this information in an Excel sheet for further analysis.

Approach
We used Python and the Beautiful Soup library to scrape data from the Wuzzuf website.We first identified the HTML tags and attributes associated with
the information we wanted to extract.We then wrote a script to extract this information from the HTML code of each job posting.

To improve the efficiency of the web scraping process, we used multiprocessing to scrape data from multiple job postings simultaneously.
We also implemented error handling and logging to handle any errors that may arise during the web scraping process.

After scraping the data, we cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure consistency and accuracy. We then stored the data in an Excel sheet for further analysis.

Conclusion
This project demonstrated the potential of web scraping as a tool for collecting data on job postings from the Wuzzuf website. 
The extracted data can be used for various purposes, such as analyzing job trends, identifying skills in demand, and comparing salaries across different industries 
and regions.

The code and results of this project can be found in this repository, and can be used as a starting point for further research on job market analysis
and related topics
